Features:
Packet Capture: Ability to capture packets from a network interface.
Packet Parsing: Parse captured packets to extract relevant information such as source IP, destination IP, protocol type, etc.
Filtering: Implement filtering mechanisms to capture specific types of traffic (e.g., based on IP address, port number, protocol).
Decoding: Decode packet payloads to understand the contents of protocols such as HTTP, DNS, etc.
Packet Manipulation: Modify packet contents before forwarding them, for example, changing headers, payload, etc.
Logging: Log captured packets and any modifications made to them for further analysis.
Integration with iptables: Ability to create iptables rules dynamically based on captured traffic or user-defined criteria.
